# GarbageGame
Front end javascript engine is located at ```/garbage_game/engine/```

Server side is curently in development, I'm still learning django, so just use ```live-server``` from npm to render the html page,
later I'll fix the django server to make everything accessible later.

If you know django enough you can help me, it would be helpful!

### to install live-server
```
#install npm
sudo pacman -S npm
#install globally live-server
sudo npm install live-server -G
```
