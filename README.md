# Garbage engine

Side project game engine using canvas in HTML5.

## Vision

Create a game engine to allow devs a technical alternative for online game development. Ideally with an online component/toolbox to deploy massive scale games using a sass hosting in-house platform. Ideally the devops sass would be a paid platform tailored to this engine, with an asset shop. 

Altought there is monetisation potential, I want to keep this engine a 100% free to whom may have the skill to host/scale the game on it's own.

Another aspect of the engine is, altough it's technical nature, I want it to be simple to read to a point where it's simpler to read this code than learning Unity or Unreal blueprint.

## Current Objectives

- Show reel game using the engine & implementing more tools
- Proper documentation of the engine
- CI/CD DevOps setup
